# AutoMTS: fully autonomous processing of multivariate time series data from heterogeneous sensor networks

AutoMTS provides open-source tool able to assess the significance of autonomous processing in multivariate time series data. AutoMTS makes available:
- autonomous missing values imputation and parameter-free selection of imputations methods
- autonomous outliers detection and parameter-free selection of the outliers detection methods
- selection of multivariate time series from heterogeneous sensor networks
- supports an extensive state-of-the-art methods for either multivariate and univariate time series
